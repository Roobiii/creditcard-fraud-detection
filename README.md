# Credit Card Fraud Detection using R

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques implemented in R. The dataset used for training and testing is the widely used [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle.

## Dependencies
- R (version X.X.X)
- R packages:
  - caret
  - randomForest
  - ggplot2
  - dplyr
  - 

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
install.packages(c("caret", "randomForest", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "scales", "DMwR", "ROSE", "pROC", "data.table", "caretEnsemble", "MASS", "e1071", "pROC", ...))

USAGE
Navigate to the project directory:
cd credit-card-fraud-detection

Run the main R script:
Rscript credit_card_fraud_detection.R

Results
After running the script, the model will be trained and evaluated using the provided dataset. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be displayed. Additionally, visualizations of the data and model performance may be generated.
